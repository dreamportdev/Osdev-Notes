# Framebuffer

One way to enable framebuffer is asking grub to do it. 

## Setting framebuffer using grub

To enable framebuffer using grub, you need to add the relevant tag in the multiboot2 header. 
So in the tag section you need to add: 

```assembly
framebuffer_tag_start:
    dw  0x05    ;Type: framebuffer
    dw  0x01    ;Optional tag
    dd  framebuffer_tag_end - framebuffer_tag_start ;size
    dd  0   ;Width - if 0 we let the bootloader decide
    dd  0   ;Height - same as above
    dd  0   ;Depth  - same as above
framebuffer_tag_end:
```

The comments are self explanatory. 

## Accessing the framebuffer from the kernel

Once the framebuffer is set in the multiboot header, when grub loads the kernel it should add  a new tag: the framebuffer info tag. As explained in the Multiboot paragraph, if you are 
using the header provided in the documentation, you should already have a *struct multiboot_tag_framebuffer*, otherwise you should create your own.  

The basic structure of the framebuffer info tag is: 

| Size    | Description        |
|---------|--------------------|
| u32     | type = 8           |
| u32     | size               |
| u64     | framebuffer_addr   |
| u32     | framebuffer_pitch  |
| u32     | framebuffer_width  |
| u32     | framebuffer_height |
| u8      | framebuffer_bpp    |
| u8      | framebuffer_type   |
| u8      | reserved           |
| varies  | color_info         |
        
Where: 

* *type* is the type of the tag being read, and 8 means that it is a Framebuffer info tag.
* *size* it indicates the size of the tag (header info included)
* *framebuffer_addr* it contains the current address of the framebuffer
* *framebuffer_pitch* contains the pitch in bytes
* *framebuffer_width* contains the fb width
* *framebuffer_height* contains the fb height
* *framebuffer_bpp* it contains the number of bits per pixel (is the depth in the multiboot request tag)
* *framebuffer_type* it indicates the current type of FB, and the content of color_index
* *reserved* is always 0 and should be ignored.
* *color_info*  it depends on the framebuffer type. 

**Pitch** is the number of bytes on each row
**bpp** is same as depths

## Framebuffer type

Depending on the framebuffer_type value you have different values for color_info field.

* If frambuffer_type is 0 this means indexed colors, this means that the color-info field has the following values:

| Size    | Description                    |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| u32     | framebuffer_palette_num_colors |
| varies  | framebuffer_palette            |

The framebuffer_palette_num_colors is the number of colors available in the palette, and the framebuffer plaette is an array of colour descriptors, where every colour has the following structure:

| Size    | Description                    |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| u8      | red_val                        |
| u8      | green_val                      |
| u8      | blue_val                       |


* If it is 1 it means direct RGB color, then the color_type is defined as follows: 	

Size   | Description					  |
-------|----------------------------------|
u8     | framebuffer_red_field_position   |
u8     | framebuffer_red_mask_size        |
u8     | framebuffer_green_field_position |
u8     | framebuffer_green_mask_size      |
u8     | framebuffer_blue_field_position  |
u8     | framebuffer_blue_mask_size       |

Where framebuffer_XXX_field_position is the starting bit of the color XXX, and the framebuffer_XXX_mask_size is the size in bits of the color XXX. Usually the format is 0xRRGGBB (is the same format used in HTML).

* If it is 2, it means EGA text, so the width and height are specified in characters and not pixels, framebuffer-bpp = 16 and framebuffer_pitch is expressed in byte text per line.
