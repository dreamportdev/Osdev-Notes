This repository is a collection of notes about operating systems development. Written by the authors while writing (and re-writing) our own operating systems. The notes are organised like a book, with the intent of guiding the reader through the various stages of building an operating system kernel from scratch.

Currently these notes are a work in progress, but many chapters are functionally complete and available to read below. We'll keep updating old chapters and adding new ones over time so be sure to check back occasionally.

We hope you enjoy, and find something interesting here!
