# Inter-Process Communication

This part will explain how to make two processes safely communicate with each other, providing two implementation examples.

Below the list of chapters:

- [Shared_Memory](02_Shared_Memory.md) the easiest way for two processes to communicate each other is set some memory area that is accessible to both. This chapter will guide through its implementation.
- [Message Passing](03_Message_Passing.md) will cover the message passing protocol. That allows different processes to communicate through the exchange of messages.
