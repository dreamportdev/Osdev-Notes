# Going Beyond

## Introduction

If you have reached that far in this guide this means that your kernel should have all the basic components to start to add new features to it, and probably being to thing to make it more interactive with the users. In this chapter we are going to explore some features that can be added to our kernel. It is going to be just a very high level overview just explaining what are the prerequisites and a short paragraph on what should be done to implement it. 

But at this point of development any feature can be added, and it is up to you what direction your kernel should take, so what you find here are just ideas, but then it's up to you.
